# Webpack, React & Dragula

This is an app intended as introduction to making use of the awesomeness of [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).  
The goal is to build a Drag & Drop app, powered by the well-known [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and also [Dragula](http://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/), a very light library which you can't help but love.

## Installing

Run ```npm install``` and then ```npm run build```.  
The application will be built in the ***www*** folder.
